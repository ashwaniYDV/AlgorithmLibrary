/*
Given an array A of length N. You have to answer Q queires.
Each query will contain 4 integers l1, r1, l2 and r2. If sorted segment from [l1, r1] is same as sorted segment from [l2 r2] then answer is 1 else 0.
NOTE The queries are 0-indexed.

Problem Constraints
0 <= A[i] <= 100000
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Q <= 100000


Input Format
First argument is an array A.
Second will be 2-D array B denoting queries with dimension Q * 4.
Consider ith query as l1 = B[i][0], r1 = B[i][1], l2 = A[i][2], r2 = B[i][3].

Output Format
Return an array of length Q with answer of the queries in the same order in input.



Input 1:
 A = [1, 7, 11, 8, 11, 7, 1]
 B = [ 
       [0, 2, 4, 6]
     ]
Output 1:
[1]

Input 2:
 A = [1, 3, 2]
 B = [
       [0, 1, 1, 2]
     ] 
Output 2: 
[0]

/*
Think hashing.
Try to find a hash function f(a,b) for subarray [a,a+1,â€¦b] such that chances of collisions are rare.


If both sub-arrays are exactly same after sorting then their sum of values will be same. 
So, we can just find the sum in range [l1, r1] and sum in range[l2, r2]. If they are different then we are sure that ans is 0. 
But, if they equal then? Consider two sub-arrays [3 5] and [4 4]. Both have sum 8 but still they are different.
Actually above approach fails because input can be carefully chosen.

Now, still we can use same idea but let first assign each value a unique random label from very big range like from 0 to 10^13 
(uoto 10^13 because no of queries can be upto 10^5 and thus the total can be upto 10^18 which will fit in long long). 
Now, probability of failure will be very less that can be neglected with given constraints.

Note: Any solution with random hashing is not 100% correct, possibility of failure exists. 
But with wide range of numbers probability of failure will be too small.

Note: Make sure that you are assign same label to all the occurrences. If value 5 comes 3 times then each 3 occurrences should be assigned same random label. 
Make sure you are using appropriate data type. Also, choosing big range like from 0 to 10^15 can overflow long long int.
