```
Notes:
* a + b => here a,b are operands and + is an operator
* Priority / precedence of operators
  ^      = 1st priority
  /, *   = 2nd priority
  +, -   = 3rd priority
  others = least priority

* prefix = <OPERATOR><operand1><operand2>
* infix = <operand1><OPERATOR><operand2>
* postfix = <operand1><operand2><OPERATOR>

* Infix is the one we mostly use in our day to day maths

* Example:

        Prefix              Infix                 Postfix
    * + p q - m n       (p + q) * (m - n)       p q + m n - *
