### Some Techniques

1) Print all the subsets of a mask, i.e submasks (SOS DP suboptimal solution concept)

```
void solve() {
    int mask = 25; // any number
    for(int i = mask; i > 0; i = (i-1) & mask) {
        string s = bitset<32>(i).to_string();
        cout << s << endl;
    }
}

Output:
00000000000000000000000000011001
00000000000000000000000000011000
00000000000000000000000000010001
00000000000000000000000000010000
00000000000000000000000000001001
00000000000000000000000000001000
00000000000000000000000000000001

```

2) Sunny's "Adobe Emerge" interview question

You are given a very big file containing the binary representation of a natural number,find whether the number is divisible by 5 or not.

You are given a utility function which will tell you the current bit when you call it, the next time it is called it will give next bit, so onâ€¦ once it gives anything apart from 0/1 , it means the file has ended.

I told him we keep on adding the modulo 5 of all powers iterating from LSB to MSB
Somewhat like ans = (ans + BinExp( 2, i , 5) ) % 5

He told the no of bits are so large that even i will overflow basically i cant even count the bits in a variable, i can just iterate over the file , and told me to think of another solution 

He repeatedly kept on saying this is a pure computer science fundamental problem and there is no pattern or trick for it and is an easy one. I couldn't make any sense  and couldn't solve it. After interview i found it is DFA problem (formal lang automata theory) (thats why he was saying basic CSF problem ;_;) (basically go from MSB to LSB and do next = (currnt*2 + bit)%5 )


https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-pattern-to-binary-numbers-divisible-by-5

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number, divisor;
    cin >> number;
    // can be generalized to any divisor, eg: (divisor = 13)
    divisor = 5;

    int cur = 0, next = 0;
    for (int i = 30; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (number & (1 << i)) {
            next = (cur * 2 + 1) % divisor;
        } else {
            next = (cur * 2 + 0) % divisor;
        }
        cur = next;
    }
    cout << "Remainder = " << cur << endl;
}
```
