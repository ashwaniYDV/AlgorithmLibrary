/*
You were asked to write a new data structure that would be able to return quickly k-th order statistics in the array segment.
That is, given an array a[1 ... n] of different integer numbers, your program must answer a series of questions Q(i, j, k) in the form: 
"What would be the k-th number in a[i ... j] segment, if this segment was sorted?"

For example, consider the array a = (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4). 
Let the query be Q(2, 5, 3). 
The segment a[2 ... 5] is (5, 2, 6, 3). 
If we sort this segment, we get (2, 3, 5, 6), the third number is 5, and therefore the answer to the question is 5.

/*
Solution Idea:

Firstly, we maintain a vector of pairs where each pair {value, index} is such that first element of pair represents the element of the input array 
and the second element of the pair represents the index at which it occurs.

Now we sort this vector of pairs on the basis of the first element of each pair.

After this we build a Merge Sort Tree where each node has a vector of indices in the sorted range.

When we have to answer a query we find if the Kth smallest number lies in the left sub-tree or in the right sub-tree. 
The idea is to use two binary searches and find the number of elements in the left sub-tree such that that the indices lie within the given query range.
Let the number of such indices be X.

If X >= K, it means we will be able to find the Kth smallest Number in the left sub-tree thus we call on the left sub-tree.

Else the Kth smallest number lies in the right sub-tree but this time we donâ€™t have to look for the K th smallest number 
as we already have first X smallest numbers of the range in the left sub-tree thus we should look for the remaining part 
ie the (K - X)th number in the right sub-tree.

This is the Index of Kth smallest number the value at this index is the required number.
