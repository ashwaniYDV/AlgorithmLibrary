# Macros
Anything that starts with a **'#'** is a *preprocessor directive*. A macro is a preprocessor directive which in essence performs a find and replace on code before it is actually compiled. You may read more about it from [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/). 

When it comes to cp, macros are quite useful. Here are a few common ones (along with some other useful things).

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define pb emplace_back
#define sz(x) int(x.size())
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define trace(x) cerr << #x << " = " << x << '\n'

using namespace std;
const array dx{1, 0, -1, 0};
const array dy{0, 1, 0, -1};
template<class T> bool chmax(T& A, T&& B) 
    { return B > A? A = B, true : false; }
template<class T> bool chmin(T& A, T&& B) 
    { return B < A? A = B, true : false; }

const int64_t DESPACITO = 2e18;
const int INF = 2e9, MOD = 1e9+7;
const int MxN = 2e5 + 5;

int32_t main() {
    cin.tie(nullptr)->sync_with_stdio(false);
    // ...
}
```

## A few notes
### FastIO
```c++
cin.tie(nullptr)->sync_with_stdio(false);
```
The ```std::cin``` and ```std::cout``` streams may sometimes be too slow. Thus when there is large input, it is common practice to disable synchronization with stdio and flushing before every ```cin```. You may refer to [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fast-io-for-competitive-programming/) for a better understanding on what it does, and how it works.

### endl vs '\n'
Using ```'\n'``` is better (no flushing, so, faster) than using ```std::endl``` (in the context of cp) and [here's](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-the-difference-between-endl-and-n-in-cpp) why. 

However, remember to use ```std::endl``` in [interactive problems](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307), not ```'\n'``` as it is required to flush the output.

### The size() method and where you can go wrong with it
The ```size()``` method, compatible with most STL containers, returns a value of type ```size_t```, which is an *unsigned int*. When comparisons are made between values of different data types, the compiler (implicitly) typecasts one of them to the other, and when a negative integer of type ```int``` is casted to an ```unsigned int```, the expression may evaluate to a different value altogether. 

```c++
vector<int> vect{1, 2, 3};
for(int i = 0; i < (int)vect.size(); i++)
  // do stuff
```

### Debugging using the power of macros
The *stringizing* operator (*#*) turns source code into text tokens, i.e, it can turn parameters into string literals.

Try this out.
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define watch(x) cout << #x << " = " << x << endl
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    watch(a);
    return 0;
}
```
