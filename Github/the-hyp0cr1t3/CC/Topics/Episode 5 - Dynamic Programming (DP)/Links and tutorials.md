# DP Links and tutorials

Dynamic Programming, or DP, is an approach to solving problems through 'clever bruteforce'. Its applications are vast, and difficulty of such problems range from easy to very hard.

If you're following this series, DP could be quite a jump in terms of difficulty and thinking of approaches to problems. Take your time to assimilate the contents of the following links/guides and understand what's going on. The internet has a lot more resources to explore if you're stuck. 

That said, here are some links I've found helpful in my competitive programming journey.
