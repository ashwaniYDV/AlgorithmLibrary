# Implementation and Greedy

## Ad hoc/Implementation
Implementation problems do not rely on the knowledge of any particular data structure or algorithm and instead require the usage of pure logic. There isn't really any way to learn this method except to practice problems.

#### Problems
* [Codeforces 1030 A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1030/A)
* [Codeforces 977 A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/977/A)
* [Codeforces 1201 A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1201/A)
* [Codeforces 1157 A](https://codeforces.com/contest/1157/problem/A)

**Note:** Sometimes the input may be large enough to cause an overflow. So remember to use long long (64-bit integer) instead of int (32-bit integer). It is safe to assume anything above 2x10<sup>9</sup> overflows *int*, and anything above 2x10<sup>18</sup> overflows *long long int*

## Greedy
As the name suggests, a greedy approach is one where (greedily) picking the **best option** at every stage leads to the **best outcome**.

Problems mentioned in this episode, as well as subsequent ones, are only meant to serve as an introduction to a topic and are by no means enough to make you an expert at it (unless you are a genius). Be sure to practice more problems on the topics. You may go to [Problemset](https://codeforces.com/problemset) on Codeforces and filter by tag and/or rating to find appropriate problems.
