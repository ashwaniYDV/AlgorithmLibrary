# Sorting and frequency tables

[Frequency table tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-frequencies-of-array-elements/)

Frequency tables are not limited to arrays only. You can build a frequency table using a map (most commonly for large elements which cannot be indexed using arrays/vectors). However this would need **O(log N**) lookup time, unlike arrays/vectors which require **O(1)** time.
