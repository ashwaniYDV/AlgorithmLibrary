/*
Deleting a derived class object using a pointer of base class type that has a non-virtual destructor results in undefined behavior. 
To correct this situation, the base class should be defined with a virtual destructor. 

Note: Base class pointer can point to the objet of derived class but not vice versa

Note:
There is nothing like Virtual Constructor. 
Making constructors virtual doesn't make sense as constructor is responsible for creating an object 
and it canâ€™t be delegated to any other object by virtual keyword means.
