/*
Friend Class:
A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. 
It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class. 
For example, a LinkedList class may be allowed to access private members of Node. 
*/

class Node {
private:
    int key;
    Node* next;
    /* Other members of Node Class */

    // Now class LinkedList can access private members of Node
    friend class LinkedList;
};


/*
Friend Function: 
Like friend class, a friend function can be given a special grant to access private and protected members. 
A friend function can be: 
a) A member of another class 
b) A global function 
*/

class Node {
private:
    int key;
    Node* next;

    /* Other members of Node Class */
    friend int LinkedList::search();
    // Only search() of linkedList can access internal members
};



/*
Following are some important points about friend functions and classes: 
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. 
   If too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, 
   it lessens the value of encapsulation of separate classes in object-oriented programming.
2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
3) Friendship is not inherited (See this for more details)
4) The concept of friends is not there in Java.
