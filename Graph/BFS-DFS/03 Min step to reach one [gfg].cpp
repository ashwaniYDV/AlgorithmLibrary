/*
Given a positive number N, we need to reach to 1 in minimum number of steps where a step is defined as 
converting N to (N-1) or converting N to its one of the bigger divisor. 
Formally, if we are at N, then in 1 step we can reach to (N â€“ 1) or if N = u*v then we can reach to max(u, v) where u > 1 and v > 1.
