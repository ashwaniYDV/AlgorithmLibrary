Kuhn's Algorithm for Maximum Bipartite Matching
------------------------------------------------

Problem:

You are given a bipartite graph G containing n vertices and m edges. 
Find the maximum matching, i.e., select as many edges as possible so that no selected edge shares a vertex with any other selected edge.
