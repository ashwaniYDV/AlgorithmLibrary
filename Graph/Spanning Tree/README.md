[Total number of Spanning Trees in a Graph - GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/total-number-spanning-trees-graph/)

NOTE: (Spanning tree is defined for a connected graph)

If graph is not complete: \
No of ST = (No of Edges)C(n - 1) - (No of Cycles)

If graph is not complete: \
No of ST = n ^ (n - 2)
