## [Total number of Spanning Trees in a Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/total-number-spanning-trees-graph/#:~:text=If%20a%20graph%20is%20a,of%20nodes%20in%20the%20graph.)
If a graph is a complete graph with n vertices, then total number of spanning trees is n(n-2)\
where n is the number of nodes in the graph. 
In complete graph, the task is equal to counting different labeled trees with n nodes for which have Cayleyâ€™s formula.
