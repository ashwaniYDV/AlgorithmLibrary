## Discovery of graph theory by Euler:
Eulerian refers to the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who invented graph theory in the 18th century.

#### 7 bridges of Königsberg:
The history of graph theory may be specifically traced to 1735, when the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler solved the Königsberg bridge problem. The Königsberg bridge problem was an old puzzle concerning the possibility of finding a path over every one of seven bridges that span a forked river flowing past an island—but without crossing any bridge twice. Euler argued that no such path exists. His proof involved only references to the physical arrangement of the bridges, but essentially he proved the first theorem in graph theory.

#### Euler Tour: 
Can begin and end with different nodes visiting all edges only once
#### Euler Cycle: 
Should begin and end with same node visiting all edges only once
