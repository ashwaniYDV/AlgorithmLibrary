/*
You are given a directed graph, and your task is to find out if it contains a negative cycle, and also give an example of such a cycle.

Input:
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. 
The nodes are numbered 1,2,â€¦,n.
After this, the input has m lines describing the edges. 
Each line has three integers a, b, and c: there is an edge from node a to node b whose length is c.
*/

/*
Approach:
Perform N-1 iterations of Bellman-Ford algorithm and relax each edge (u, v). 
Keep track of parent of each vertex and store in an array parent[].
Now, do one more iteration and if no edge relaxation take place in this Nth iteration, then there is no cycle of negative weight exists in the graph.

Otherwise take a variable node and store the vertex v from any edge (u, v), which is relaxed in the Nth iteration.
Now, starting from the node vertex go towards its ancestors until a cycle is found and finally print it.
This cycle will be the desired cycle of negative weight.
