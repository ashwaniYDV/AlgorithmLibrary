/*
Byteland has n cities and m flight connections. Your task is to design a round trip that begins in a city, 
goes through one or more other cities, and finally returns to the starting city. Every intermediate city on the route has to be distinct.

Input:
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,â€¦,n.
Then, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight connection from city a to city b. 
All connections are one-way flights from a city to another city.

Output:
First print an integer k: the number of cities on the route. Then print k cities in the order they will be visited. You can print any valid solution.
If there are no solutions, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
