/*
There are n cities and m flight connections. Your task is to check if you can travel from any city to any other city using the available flights.

Input:
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,â€¦,n.
After this, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight from city a to city b. 
All flights are one-way flights.

Output:
Print "YES" if all routes are possible, and "NO" otherwise. 
In the latter case also print two cities a and b such that you cannot travel from city a to city b.
