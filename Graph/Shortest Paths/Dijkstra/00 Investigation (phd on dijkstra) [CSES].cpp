/*
You are going to travel from city 1 to city n by plane. You would like to find answers to the following questions:
a) what is the minimum price of such a route?
b) how many minimum-price routes are there? (modulo 10^9+7)
c) what is the minimum number of flights in a minimum-price route?
d) what is the maximum number of flights in a minimum-price route?

Input:
The first input line contains two integers n and m: the number of cities and the number of flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,â€¦,n. 
After this, there are m lines describing the flights. 
Each line has three integers a, b, and c: there is a flight from city a to city b with price c. 
All flights are one-way flights.
You may assume that there is a route from city 1 to city n.

Output:
Print four integers according to the problem statement.

/*
Time Complexity: 0(E log V) 

We can run dijkstra keeping track of the ->
distance: dis[], 
number of ways with the minimum distance: numOfWays[] 
minimum no of flights with the minimum distance: minFlights[]
maximum no of flights with the minimum distance: maxFlights[]

For every node u, we take into consideration all of its neighbors v. 
If we can reach v in a shorter distance than its current minimum, we update the dis[v] and reset numOfWays[v], minFlights[v], and maxFlights[v]. 
We also have to take into consideration if we can reach v in an equivalent distance. 
If so, we update: 
numOfWays[v] = numOfWays[v] + numOfWays[u]
minFlights[v] = min(minFlights[v], minFlights[u] + 1)
maxFlights[v] = max(maxFlights[v], maxFlights[u] + 1)

Consider priority queue method 1:
Let priority queue pq state currently = [{2, node1}, {5, node2}]
node1 is poped frpm pq
pq state currently = [{5, node2}]
Assume node1 relaxes node2 ans pushes {3, node2}
pq state currently = [{3, node2}, {5, node2}]

This is why we are using vis array in priority queue method so that we do not overcount numOfWays or update minFlights or update maxFlights.
By vis array we ensure {3, mode2} is popped once and necessary calulations and done and {5, node2} is skipped.


Consider priority queue method 2:
This line can be used to counter the above affect.
if(cost > dis[u]) continue;


Consider set method 3:
vis array is not required in set because we do these 2 steps which ensures {5, node2} is deleted and then {3, node2} is inserted 
st.erase({dis[v], v});
st.insert({dis[v], v});
