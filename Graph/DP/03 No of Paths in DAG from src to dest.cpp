/*
Problem:
A game has n levels, connected by m teleporters, and your task is to get from level 1 to level n. 
The game has been designed so that there are no directed cycles in the underlying graph. In how many ways can you complete the game?
Input:
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of levels and teleporters. The levels are numbered 1,2,â€¦,n.
After this, there are m lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a teleporter from level a to level b.
Output:
Print one integer: the number of ways you can complete the game. Since the result may be large, print it modulo 10^9+7.

/*
Solution:
Time Complexity: O(N + M)
This problem is very similar to the "Longest Flight Route" problem. 
Let dp[v] denote the number of paths reaching v. 
Clearly: 
dp[v] = Summation{edge u->v exists dp[u]},
        or 1 if v is src node
We process the nodes topologically so dp[u] will already have been computed before dp[v].
