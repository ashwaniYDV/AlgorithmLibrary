#### 0-1 Knpsack
* Subset sum
* Equal sum partition
* Count of subsets with a given sum
* Minimum subset sum difference
* Target Sum (+- wali) 

#### Unbounded Knpsack
* Rod cutting
* Coin change: max no of ways
* Coin change: min no of coins

NOTE: Unbounded kanpsack type problems can also be solved in O(m) memory only.

#### Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
* Longest common subsequence
* Print LCS
* Shortest Common Supersequence
* Print SCS
* Minimum no of insertion and deletion s1 -> s2
* Largest repeating subsequence
* Length of longest subsequence of s1 which is substring of s2
* Count how many times s1 appears as a subsequence in s2
* Largest palindromic subsequence
* Largest palindromic substring
* Count of palindromic substring
* Minimum no of deletions in a string to make it palindrome
* Minimum no of insertions in a string to make it palindrome
