/*
Given an integer n, the task is to count Dyck words possible of length n. 
A DYCK word is a word containing only characters ‘X’ and ‘Y’ such that in every prefix of the word frequency(‘X’) ≥ frequency(‘Y’)

Examples: 

Input: n = 2 
Output: 2 
“XY” and “XX” are the only possible DYCK words of length 2.
Input: n = 5 
Output: 42
