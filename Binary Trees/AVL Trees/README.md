#### AVL tree
* An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.
* In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
* If at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

Note:
* Balanced BST = A BST is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

#### Que) What is the worst case possible height of AVL tree?
* Ans: 1.44logn \
* Explanation: http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/dsa/node112.html \
* Note: This is greater than minimum possible height = logn \
* AVL tree doesnâ€™t guarantee the minimum possible height as in the worst case height of AVL tree can be 1.44*logn
