### 1. Full Binary Tree
Full Binary Tree is a Binary Tree in which every node has 0 or 2 children.

Interesting Fact: For Full Binary Tree, following equation is always true.

Number of Leaf nodes = Number of Internal nodes + 1


### 2. Complete Binary Tree
Complete Binary Tree has all levels completely filled with nodes except the last level and in the last level, all the nodes are as left side as possible.

Interesting Fact: Binary Heap is an important use case of Complete Binary tree.


### 3. Perfect Binary Tree
Perfect Binary Tree is a Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have 2 children and all the leaf nodes are at the same depth or same level.

Interesting Fact: Total number of nodes in a Perfect Binary Tree with height H is 2^H â€” 1.



### 4. Balanced Binary Tree
Balanced Binary Tree is a Binary tree in which height of the left and the right sub-trees of every node may differ by at most 1.

Interesting Fact: AVL Tree and Red-Black Tree are well-known data structure to generate/maintain Balanced Binary Search Tree. 
Search, insert and delete operations cost O(log n) time in that.


### 5. Degenerate(or Pathological) Binary Tree

Degenerate Binary Tree is a Binary Tree where every parent node has only one child node.

Interesting Fact: Height of a Degenerate Binary Tree is equal to Total number of nodes in that tree.
